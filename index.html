          <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage.</p>
          <p>
            I am currently a senior software developer at Murex, a financial
            software company in Paris, France. Developer since 2005, Java
            developer since 2008.
          </p>
          <p>I possess both Brazilian and French citizenships.</p>
          <p>
            I have obtained a PhD degree in Computer Science from Joseph Fourier
            University (Grenoble, France) in 2013. My thesis focused on software
            engineering approaches (more specifically service-based approaches)
            for real-time systems. In other words, it is about how to design
            reusable time-critical software (e.g. software used in banks,
            military artefacts, or medical healthcare).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also a Master degree from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure
            d'Informatique et Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble (ENSIMAG)
            with high honors (Mention bien) and a Bachelor degree from the
            Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) with the highest
            honors (laurea acadêmica)
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides computer science, my main interests are volleyball and video
            games.

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <p>
            My first work experience was in 2003. During high school, I did an
            internship in a biochemistry lab of the Federal University of Rio
            Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Porto Alegre, my hometown. At the time,
            Prof. Dr. Diogo Onofre Gomes de Souza and his team were doing
            courses about memory and learning to students of four public high
            schools. I was chosen to be one of the ten students of my school who
            were going to attend the courses. In the end of the courses, among
            the forty students, they have chosen four to do an one-year
            internship in the Biochemistry lab. Fortunately, I was one of these
            students. The internship went so well that even when I started my
            bachelor's degree studies in Computer Science (that is, something
            unrelated to biochemistry) I've been invited to continue doing my
            internship with Prof. Dr. Diogo. And I stayed there for five years,
            from November 2003 until July 2008, when I left Brazil in order to
            start my double degree studies in Grenoble, France. In the beginning
            of this internship, my activities were all related to biochemistry
            and biology (manipulation of chemical compounds and animal
            experimentation). However, as I was doing my studies in Computer
            Science, I started to mainly perform computer-related activities
            (article redaction, data manipulation) and from 2006 until mid-2008
            I administrated their website and developed software for imaging
            analysis and astrocytes densitometry.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end of the first academic year in Grenoble, I did a six-month
            internship at Bull S.A.S. in order to validate my French Engineer's
            degree. My advisors were Dr. Walter Rudametkin and Dr. François
            Exertier. This internship consisted in creating a real-time
            prototype of the JOnAS 5 Application Server, by means of bytecode
            injection of RTSJ-compliant code. This subject was proposed by Dr.
            Rudametkin and his PhD Advisor, Prof. Dr. Didier Donsez.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing that I'd have to do another internship in the following
            year, Walter and Didier offered me a research internship in their
            laboratory at LIG (Grenoble Informatics Laboratory), involving
            real-time, Java and OSGi. As these three words were topics that
            interested me a lot, I accepted. This second internship consisted of
            studying the impacts of real-time constraints in OSGi and, at same
            time, the impact of OSGi's dynamism in real-time Java applications.
            The conflict between real-time and dynamic architectures in Java
            interested me so much, that I decided to do my PhD studies on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            My PhD studies were financed by Bull S.A.S., where I was employed as
            a R&D Engineer. You may find more about my thesis subject below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two weeks after presenting my PhD thesis, in November 2013, I
            started working at Murex, a financial software editor in Paris. I
            was hired as a junior developer in the Core Technologies - Workflow
            development team, led back then by Ms. Nadine Daccache. This team
            was responsible for MxMLExchange, the post-trade workflow engine of
            old MX.G2000 and MX.3. I was hired to be the lead developer of the
            business rules engine module, responsible for storing and executing
            business rules developed in several technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to the present day, System Architect and Software
            Function Owner of MxMLExchange, leading a team composed of seven
            developers, a product owner and a quality analyst distributed in
            three countries. I am also the operational manager of some of these
            developers.
          </p>
          <p>My daily work involves the following topics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Java (used all versions from 6 to 11)</li>
            <li>
              Analysing technical and performance issues arising from
              distributed and multithreaded applications
            </li>

          <h3>Educational background</h3>
          <p>
            In 2005, I started my undergraduate degree studies in Computer
            Science at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), one
            of the biggest and best universities in Brazil. These studies
            consisted of a nine-semester program, in which we had courses about
            the main domains of Computer Science (Computational theory,
            Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics, Image Processing,
            Operating Systems, Algorithm Complexity, etc). In the seventh
            semester (2008/1), I obtained a scholarship to finish my
            undergraduate degree studies in other country, in order to obtain a
            Double Degree. Since I could speak French fluently, I have chosen
            Grenoble as destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            For two years, I studied at Grenoble Institut of Technology
            (formerly INPG) and obtained an Engineer (academic specialization in
            Information Systems Engineering) and a Master (specialization in
            Information Systems and Advanced Software Engineering) degrees from
            ENSIMAG (École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique et Mathématiques
            Appliquées de Grenoble, one of the best Informatics schools in
            France), both with Mention Bien. Back to Brazil, I got my BSc Degree
            in Computer Science in September 2010, with Laurea Academica (an
            award given to those who obtained an A ranking on over 80% of
            courses) as well as the Highlight Student Award from the Brazilian
            Society of Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have earned a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the
            University of Grenoble in November 2013. My thesis subject was
            entitled "A component meta-model for the design of flexible and
            modular real-time applications", and it was supervised by Prof. Dr.
            Didier Donsez. In my reading and examination committee there were
            Profs. Lionel Seinturier, Jean Bézivin (reading commitee), Frédéric
            Mallet, Andy Wellings (examination committee) and Florence
            Maraninchi (chair). At Bull, my thesis was supervised by Dr.
            François Exertier and M. Frédéric Soinne.

          <h3>Competences</h3>
          <h4>Languages</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Portuguese:</em> Native Language.</li>
            <li>
              <em>English:</em> Fluent (Gold level at TOEIC, in 2009). I started
              learning it at school, when I was 10 years old. Some of my
              favorite bands at the time were American or English. That
              encouraged me to improve my english skills, what turned out to be
              very useful afterwards, when I started reading scientific papers
              and studying computer science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>French:</em> Fluent (C1 Level, according to CECR, in 2009).
              French is my second language, I speak it since I'm 5 years old. I
              had french classes during the whole primary education (8 years, in
              Brazil).
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Japanese and Greek:</em> I've started getting Japanese and
              Greek lessons, but did not have enough time yet to learn more than
              notions of both languages.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Web Technologies</h4>
          <p>
            I am a self-taught Javascript, CSS and HTML developer. On some of my
            free time, I have been playing with Javascript frameworks (like Node
            and Angular).
          </p>
          <p>
            I can also use Java-based web technologies like JSP, Servlets, JSF,
            XML, XHTML, GWT and Web Services.
          </p>
          <p>I'm more interested in back-end code.</p>
          <h4>Programming languages</h4>
          <p>
            At the university, I have learned to program in Pascal, C/C++, Java
            and Python (in that order, which does not mean preference).
          </p>
          <p>
            Java is definitely my go-to programming language for heavy
            server-side code. For anything that requires UI, I code using web
            technologies (pure HTML for simple webpages, Angular/JS for anything
            requiring dynamism). If on server side I only need to aggregate data
            from other sources, I might consider Node.js.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Other:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Database:</em> SQL Server (Derby, HSQL, MySQL), Oracle</li>
            <li>
              <em>Operating Systems:</em> Linux (Work), Windows (Work), Mac OS
              (Personal computer), Solaris (Master thesis, work)
            </li>
            <li><em>IDEs:</em> IntelliJ, Eclipse. Getting used to VSCode.</li>
            <li>
              <em>Project Management Tools:</em> SVN/Perforce, Maven, Ant, Git,
              Jenkins, Sonar.
            </li>
            <li><em>Unit test:</em> JUnit, Mockito, Cucumber</li>
            <li><em>Others:</em> LaTeX, worked a bit with Android SDK (would love to work again with it).</li>
